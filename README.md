# Introduction and Topics in Brain Sciences

This repository contains all the lecture slides and workshop materials for the event conducted in January 2022. The goal of this workshop is to teach and introduce you to varied topics needed for studying the Brain. 

We aim to cover a small subset of topics and provide an assignment to make the learning experience better. We also provide additional resources available on the web that will help you start the journey in reverse engineering the human brain.
